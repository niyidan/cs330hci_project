We find that the users tend to ignore the price selection box due to the box is not easy to find in the third prototpye. so we want to enlarge the price box or use an attractive color to remind users. or we can add a sort button in the upper area. therefore, the user can sort the stuffs by different burgets or targets.

In the task 2, we find that the users may ignore the skin type, skin tone or products button due to they are on the right size of the signup page. So we will choose the first prototype which will direct the users from their basic information page to the recommendation page. By showing all things step by step on slides, the users can be shown a clear scan line from the start to end. Also, we choose the top aligned line when design our forms which will help the users to read the required information they need to fill in easily.

In the task 3, when the users want to post pictures or videos in their profile, all three users tend to fall to find out how to get to the post page. So we want to let the post button more obvious so that the users can easily find them. we think that the profile in the prototpye 2 is a great choice because the users we tasked show more appreciations on the prototype 2's post page.
